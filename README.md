# Instructions on how to start

* Make sure you read how to use github so that you do not overwrite code and push to master/origin branch unknowingly *

1. Install node.js
2. Clone repo into a folder on your device by using "git clone " + our REPO ssh/https key
3. Go to terminal or command line prompt and navigate to that folder
4. Once in folder, type in command line "npm install" to install all the dependencies and modules in the folder
5. You can now run the application by using the command line "npm start": This will open up a tab on your browser, and you will have to click on the "Tunnel" option and then run on either iOS or Android simulator. Bobby, make sure you download a simulator for Android.
6. You guys are all set

# Instructions on where to write code

1. For CSS, it will go into a src/style folder
2. For backend and frontend code, these will go into the src/screen/"name of screen" files
3. Do not touch anything else. If you are going to be adding in new modules and dependencies make sure you pick ones that are verified and will not be taken down. You can install these by typing in the command line: "npm install 'name of module/dependency'"
4. Please remember to follow github protocols and do not overwrite master branch; work off your own branches.
